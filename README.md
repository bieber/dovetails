# Dovetails

This is a simple little project to generate dovetail layout templates
for the Shaper Origin CNC.  You can run it locally with `yarn start`
or compile a static build with `yarn build` after installing
dependencies with `yarn install`.  There is no backend for this
project, it just generates the template SVG files directly on the
frontend.

You can find the current production version of this live at
[https://dovetails.bieber.dev](https://dovetails.bieber.dev).
