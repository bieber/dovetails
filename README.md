# Dovetails

This is a simple little project to generate dovetail layout templates
for the Shaper Origin CNC.  I'm probably not going to document this a
ton since I'm mostly planning on using it for myself, but the basic
concept is that the frontend will let you lay out an arrangement of
pins on the end of your tails board, and then the backend will
generate SVGs to cut the pin and tail boards.
